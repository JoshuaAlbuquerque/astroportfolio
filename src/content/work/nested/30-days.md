Event Format

A new coding problem along with relevant material will be released on GitHub from Monday to Thursday at 10:00 PM.
You are required to maintain a fork of this GitHub repository with your solutions.
Out of the four problems posted in a week, present your solution to any one of them in a 6 minutes or less video, and email it to sceptix+daysofcode@sjec.ac.in.
Best video each week wins an Amazon voucher of ₹2000.

An additional harder problem will be released every Saturday via Hackerrank.
Solving this problem yields an Amazon voucher of ₹3000.

The top five students who consistently submit solutions to all of any weeks' problems (regardless of video entry), win ₹200 each.
There will be a mini-hackathon on day-30 for the SJEC students.
